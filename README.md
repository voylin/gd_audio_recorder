# Audio recorder - made in Godot

This project is part of a series for the YouTube channel [Voylin's Gamedev Journey](https://www.youtube.com/@voylinsgamedevjourney). The tutorial videos can be found here: [Audio recorder - made in Godot tutorial playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8opQePBSY5ny0BfqIp_WqYoOLhmhKvLM).

## Why an audio recorder?

Because I want to build most of my tools myself to learn from the process. An audio recorder is a very simple project, especially when using an game engine such as Godot. To keep things interesting I'm also implementing an Audio spectrum tool to indicate if we are actually recording audio or not.
